                        film maker, a writer, a poet, an artist at heart - when 
                        we observes this society, something therein strikes a 
                        chord - do you experience such resonances when you look 
                        for works to film?</strong> 
                        <p>Certainly. That is exactly what 
                          happens. When I read Agnisakshi ten years back, and 
                          it troubled me since; there was borne the idea that 
                          I should make a film or a teleserial out of it - there 
                          was an identification with the story itself. Truths 
                          that I could not say myself were said by Lalithambika 
                          Antherjanam; how best can I reach these invaluable insights, 
                          thoughts, words to the common man?</p>
                        <p><strong>About Agnisakshi, what is its contemporary 
                          relevance?</strong></p>
                        <p>I've never felt an irrelevance in the story. Unfortunately 
                          it has been linked mainly to the upheaval literature 
                          of the '40s and '50s. It does have stories of social 
                          reformation and. But fundamentally it is the story of 
                          the human soul; a cry from within. A marriage that can 
                          never attain peace - it coming full circle. It could 
                          happen in any community; at any point in time. Let's 
                          see what happens here - there are two characters - Unni 
                          Namboodiri and Thethi; though they both love each other, 
                          they are not able to find happiness in their lives. 
                          What is the meaning of happiness; how to achieve it? 
                          So do we set aside our physical body to attain that 
                          ulterior realm of happiness? Such questions, such fundamental, 
                          such universal questions are what the novel Agnisakshi 
                          raises. That is why it had the power to attract an artist 
                          like me, in another medium, in another generation in 
                          another context. Which means it is not just about reform 
                          and upheaval. It contains issues that touch the chord 
                          of human relationships.</p>
                        <p><strong>In Uyirthezhunnelpu and Agnisakshi we find 
                          a central character deciding to go ahead in a particular 
                          direction; and then going back on it - a rebel who later 
                          decides against it. Or to put it clich&eacute;d, an 
                          anti-revolutionary streak in the characters. Is this 
                          deliberate, or has it simply happened?</strong></p>
                        <p>That's a good observation. I haven't looked at it on 
                          that light. But probably you are right. Calling it anti 
                          revolutionary would be an oversimplification. Labeling 
                          makes it deceptively easy. But doubting people interest 
                          me. I tend to think it is a reflection of my own life. 
                          If one could find a complete answer to all these, it 
                          would have been so quick and easy. What's right, what's 
                          wrong? So it's the men who walk the grey areas in between 
                          that are more common. I see more of them and relate 
                          to them. Maybe it's 'cause of that.</p>
                        <p><strong>The problems of life; we can't find easy solutions 
                          to them.</strong></p>
                        <p>Precisely. That's how the arts and means of communication 
                          evolve. What emerges as art is something that we can't 
                          otherwise express, isn't it. Smt Lalithambika for e.g. 
                          it is some of her inner traumas that have taken the 
                          shape of Agnisakshi. The societal relevance is on one 
                          side; its spiritual conflict on the other.</p>
                        <p><strong>Coming to the casting; the choice of Rajat 
                          Kapoor has proven to be a wise one. How did you come 
                          to believe that someone from outside our milieu, I'm 
                          referring to the specifics that the story is set in 
                          - a particular class of people; in a bygone era with 
                          its own set of values, rituals, a strong sense of tradition; 
                          how was your conviction in someone like Rajat Kapoor 
                          founded?</strong></p>
                        <p>When we planned, it wasn't like we stumbled upon Rajat 
                          Kapoor in the first place. Keeping in mind the commercial 
                          prospects for the film, we did speak to a few leading 
                          actors out here. But for various reasons it didn't work 
                          out. That's how; and Rajat is someone I've taken note 
                          of in his various other performances. I've seen his 
                          theatre works while in Bombay. Have seen his ad films, 
                          works in television; he's worked with Shyam Benegal 
                          in films. I'd say that what drew me to him were his 
                          physical features. And once I was reconciled that we 
                          weren't going in for a Malayalam actor to play the role, 
                          the personality that came closest to the Unni Namboodiri 
                          that I had in mind was Rajat Kapoor. And it's not just 
                          the physical features I'm talking about here; you know 
                          it was his behavior pattern, that inner quality in him 
                          - his gentleness, humility that matched so well, so 
                          naturally with Unni Namboodiri.<br>
                          And Rajat is a fine actor, with a great deal of devotion, 
                          intensity; has a theatre of tradition behind him; he 
                          took great pains in trying to understand the lifestyle 
                          of the Namboodiris - and he's a Punjabi; had nothing 
                          in common at all with the culture we were portraying. 
                          But it was his effort and with his talent ...</p>
                        <p><strong>Aha, so he actually studied their lifestyle?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, yes, their behavior pattern and all. We were shooting 
                          in an old Illom; and kind of modeled the character of 
                          Unni Namboodiri on the patriarch there - his walking 
                          pattern. So with great effort and hard work, we have 
                          achieved this.</p>
                        <p><strong>On the other side; the image of Shobhana - 
                          that of an actress in the popular imagination; has that 
                          image affected somewhat the character she plays in the 
                          film?</strong></p>
                        <p>Well many have hinted at this. You see this was a work 
                          that was always going to be difficult to cast, what 
                          with the generation gap in the narrative and all that. 
                          And so we've had to take some tough decisions on the 
                          casting, wasn't exactly a happy one for all. I guess 
                          within our limitations we did our best. </p>
                        <p><strong>When it comes to the characterization of Sreevidya 
                          as Thankam . . . .</strong></p>
                        <p>Exactly. 'Cause in my knowledge many prominent directors 
                          before me had given up on the idea of Agnisakshi as 
                          a feature film mainly due to the problems in casting. 
                          So the criticism wasn't entirely unexpected; with regard 
                          to some inconsistencies that we see in the film. But 
                          then, given such a difficulty I felt it was better that 
                          this story be told than backing out of it altogether. 
                          So we overlooked it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Going forward a little, to your newest production 
                          Bokshu the Myth. In the present day context, the fascination 
                          for myths, fantasy; especially in the international

                          too. Is Bokshu driven by such a trend; or has it remained 
                          with you else wise too?</strong></p>
                        <p>Bokshu is an adventure film. As a genre, adventure 
                          films always will have an enduring appeal. And cinema 
                          is primarily a medium that can incorporate adventure, 
                          fantasy; thanks to the dizzying technical effects that 
                          we're capable of delivering today. So these factors 
                          were important in making this choice. Bokshu is based 
                          on a Hindi novel by Ganga Prasad Vimal titled 'Vyaghram'. 
                          It was writer Zacharia who suggested it to me. It was 
                          while we were discussing on several possible prospects 
                          that he suggested I read this. It is a mystery novel 
                          - of a tribe in the upper reaches of the Himalayas - 
                          their belief in a magical power called Bokshu - an adventure 
                          story revolving around this.</p>
                        <p>Following Agnisakshi, I was with its producer Dr Venkatesh 
                          Parasad in Chicago when he expressed a desire to make 
                          an English film - one that would have an Indian content; 
                          with an American point of view, an American perspective. 
                          So this one quickly came to mind. And so we developed 
                          it and brought the story into another kind of format. 
                          Screenplay was collaboratively by me and Sasi Warrier, 
                          a novelist, and Richard Stanley an American writer. 
                          The cast has American actors; noted Shakespearean actor 
                          Stephen Berkoff has a leading role in the film. </p>
                        <p><strong>Are the technicians from abroad?</strong></p>
                        <p>The cameraman is Danish - Robin Fosberg, who won the 
                          best European cameraman award 'Eurimages' in Europe 
                          last year. Many other technical hands are Indian. Editing 
                          is by Sridhar Prasad. Sound recording is notable in 
                          that it uses live sound. Most Hollywood films rely on 
                          live sound. It is only in India that we have such extensive 
                          use of dubbing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Coming to live sound, is it that we do not 
                          have the technical expertise for live sound recordings, 
                          is it something that we have yet to catch up on?</strong></p>
                        <p>Well, I see it as a problem with our attitude. My first 
                          two telefilms both used live sound. Looking back now, 
                          it now sounds unbelievable. Without a generator, with 
                          available light, a little spotlight - it was a telefilm 
                          that used live sound recording! It was done within our 
                          limited resources then. Our technical people as well 
                          as our actors have a viewpoint that acting, as in dialogues, 
                          is a separate entity. This makes it very easy for them; 
                          they don't have to study their lines, silence is not 
                          necessary on the sets. So that they can carry on with 
                          their cell phone conversations even as acting goes on 
                          in a corner. This shows a lack of devotion in our creative 
                          endeavors. In the west, they wouldn't take a 'dubbed', 
                          a fully post synchronized film, as they call it, seriously. 
                          You cannot take a dubbed film abroad seriously. It is 
                          such an important thing. But here we have this 'prompting' 
                          and all these dubious practices - which have destroyed 
                          the concept of live sound. I would like to bring it 
                          back. Often due to limited financial means I haven't 
                          been able to do so; but my efforts shall be geared towards 
                          this.</p>
                        <p>The live sound for Bokshu was done by Bombay based 
                          sound recordist Nakul Kamte. He'd won the National Award 
                          for the sound recording of Lagaan. He has his facilities 
                          all in Bombay. And Bokshu has a very enjoyable, a very 
                          real sound track.</p></td>
