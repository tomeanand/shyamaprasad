                        shooting in India, in the setup that people are used to 
                        here - did you find this a challenge? </strong> 
                        <p>Well, there was an unfamiliarity yes. The crew, particularly 
                          the lighting crew, and other technical assistants - 
                          are all used to making a big ruckus on the sets. And 
                          since they do not have a habit of concentrated work, 
                          we had lots of problems. We had to use signboards saying 
                          'this is a live studio', you know 'this is a hot studio', 
                          'a hot floor, so please maintain silence.'</p>
                        <p>Once they got used to it, the actors; and there are 
                          a sizeable number of Indian actors too in the cast - 
                          all found it a great experience. For an actor to have 
                          fullest satisfaction, nothing can replace the sound 
                          that he actually uses while acting.</p>
                        <p><strong>Casting would also have been a challenge...</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, casting was very important. We had English speaking 
                          Indian actors. But you wouldn't find them speaking American 
                          English; they speak natural Indian English. So we worked 
                          with Irfan Khan, Bombay based actor from the National 
                          School of Drama, Nandana Sen, Amartya Sen's daughter, 
                          Malayalam actor Vineet, Harish Patel and Mita Vasisht; 
                          both based in Bombay - all spoke natural Indian English; 
                          and the quality of live sound is amazing.</p>
                        <p><strong>From Uyirthezhunnelpu, Nilavariyunnu, Maranam 
                          Durbalam and then onward to Bokshu; though in subject 
                          matter there are similarities, there are wide ranging 
                          differences too. We get to see a great range in your 
                          works. Now, the language of cinema is centered on several 
                          aspects - its technique, its structure and so on. Who 
                          are the directors who have affected you, influenced 
                          you?</strong></p>
                        <p>Well, to tell the truth there is no single person. 
                          As I said earlier, my film and television works - as 
                          you've said they span a range of styles. On the one 
                          hand you have such films as Uyirthezhunnelpu; and on 
                          the other you have Vishwa Vikhyatamaaya Mookku; a very 
                          caricaturish animation film. So the films all fall into 
                          different patterns. I wouldn't name any single influence; 
                          but I'll name the filmmakers whose works I like to see. 
                          Among Western film makers, I enjoy the films of Woody 
                          Allen immensely, Cuppola and ... there's a whole list 
                          of American directors. In European cinema there are 
                          stylists such as Kieslowski, Tarkovsky. Italians film 
                          makers such as Fellini have impressed me tremendously. 
                          So there are ever so many.</p>
                        <p><strong>How about Indian film makers?</strong></p>
                        <p>Among new Indian directors, I find Mani Ratnam's work 
                          very touching; it has guided me at various moments. 
                          So you see it's just that there's no categorization 
                          in my liking.</p>
                        <p><strong>So how would you assimilate all these influences; 
                          all these names you've mentioned....</strong></p>
                        <p>Exactly, it's an eclectic collection. Absolutely. And 
                          I don't think these are any contradictory influences 
                          either. In Malayalam, in craft and talent there's Siddique 
                          (of the Siddique Lal duo), who's really at the forefront. 
                          And just as I enjoy his work and its nuances, I would 
                          enjoy a film by Adoor Gopalakrishnan. Which is possible; 
                          they don't actually stand at diametrically opposite 
                          points. It's just two people, with their own viewpoints, 
                          their own manner of expressiveness. That's all the difference 
                          there is - I don't see a divide in this.</p>
                        <p>Ultimately, it's more than technical expertise. It's 
                          what you want to convey, you know, the finer element. 
                          I think the greatest danger would be that a director 
                          be known solely for his technical ingenuity. One should 
                          find a rarer quality of truth that can be expressed. 
                          Other gimmicks are all temporary - would change depending 
                          on the fashion.</p>
                        <p><strong>How about the music; here again we find many 
                          changes. In Uyirthezhunnelpu for example, there is extensive 
                          use of Western music. Thereon, again there are several 
                          changes. How do you make these decisions?</strong></p>
                        <p>While on this, music as I've used in the telefilms 
                          particularly, is the available music.... which is not 
                          actually right. It's another's rightful intellectual 
                          property. Its use deprives our composers of an opportunity 
                          too. And so now I look back on it with a measure of 
                          guilt.</p>
                        <p><strong>But then, there's something like the permissible 
                          length, isn't it?</strong></p>
                        <p>I'm not talking about the legal issues here; I'm talking 
                          about the ethical issues. When I speak to my composer 
                          friends, this issue does come up time and again. But 
                          basically, I started my collection of music several 
                          years ago, Western composers, film tracks were a particular 
                          interest of mine. It gives me great pleasure to listen 
                          to soundtracks and instrumental music. I've never listened 
                          to songs as such; and their lyrics - have never been 
                          attracted by them. Almost all my collections are of 
                          instrumental music of different cultures...</p>
                        <p><strong>So is your listening visual oriented?</strong></p>
                        <p>Certainly; the visuals would induce a particular kind 
                          of music. And it is a part of my work, my enjoyment 
                          - listening to soundtracks and orchestral music is my 
                          great love. While I was at DD, I was in charge of the 
                          Western music and Classical music collection there. 
                          Thus I came in contact with music lovers in Trivandrum; 
                          their collections; and could use their music in various 
                          works. But basically I believe Western classical music 
                          is the ideal for visual accompaniment. 'Cause there 
                          is the concept of harmony in Western classical music 
                          that blends perfectly with the visual medium. It is 
                          quite unlike the pattern of Indian classical music. 
                          So Western classical music features in several of my 
                          works. It often focuses on a mood; in a linear manner 
                          so to speak. On the other hand, our music while being 
                          richer, is more stylized and moves in a different pattern 
                          - has a sense of rhythm and beat; whereas Western classical 
                          is harmony based; hence it has been useful for me. But 
                          later on, many modern composers like Philip Glass, Zibgnew 
                          Presiner, Kieslowski's composer have based their work 
                          on Western classical music; and I've used their independent 
                          works. So yeah.....</p></td>
