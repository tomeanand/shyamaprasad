                        As the Himalayan snow melts, deep down in the Kumaon Valley, 
                        the myth of Bokshu spins a web of intrigue and black magic. 
                        Shyamaprasad has just returned from the Himalayas, where 
                        he had been shooting &quot;Bokshu, the Myth&quot;, his 
                        film in English. The director is busy wrapping up the 
                        international project, which will be released across four 
                        countries.<br> <br>
                        The foreigners in the cast comprise British actors Steven 
                        Berkoff and David Millbern, and American stage actress 
                        Heather Prete. The Indian cast includes Nandana Sen, daughter 
                        of Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, Irfan Khan, Harish Patel 
                        and Vineeth. &quot;The film is based on &quot;Mriganthak&quot;, 
                        a Hindi novel by Gangaprasad Vimal, which has been translated 
                        into Malayalam, &quot;Vyaghram&quot;, Paul Zachariah suggested 
                        it could be adapted to the screen.<br> <br>
                        The novel is in the format of a journal and we have modified 
                        it into a more dramatic form.&quot;<br> <br>
                        The script for the film has been written by Shyamaprasad, 
                        along with Sashi Warrier and Richard Stanley, Jaled, a 
                        village in the Himalayas, is where the myth of Bokshu 
                        is unveiled. The story centers on two American anthropologists 
                        who come in search of their lost professor and the adventures 
                        they encounter. Torben Forseberg cranks the camera, while 
                        Thota Tharani is the production designer. Kumaon, popularized 
                        by Jim Corbett's stories on man eater tigers and leopards, 
                        lends to the film an air of mystery. The natives of Kumaon 
                        valley believe in black magic and this superstition has 
                        been woven into the theme of the film.<br> <br>
                        Why did he take a break after &quot;Agnisakshi?&quot; 
                        &quot;I was making serials and decided to continue until 
                        I found a script that will fascinate me with its potential 
                        for visual exploration.&quot;<br> <br>
                        Ask him about his dream project and he says, &quot;I had 
                        planned a film on O V Vijayan's novel, &quot;Khazakinte 
                        Ithihasam&quot;. But since I was committed to this project, 
                        I decided to wait until next year to begin work. I had 
                        spent two years in a lifetime is pretty long. I had to 
                        ensure that the film was good.&quot;<br> <br>
                        It would be hypocritical, he says, were he to make films 
                        that he did not believe in. &quot;I know there will always 
                        be people who can appreciate an honest work, even if the 
                        film does not fit into the commercial mould.&quot; Ask 
                        him about his favourite directors and films, and he replies, 
                        &quot;This can be a pretty long list. My Indian favourite 
                        is Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy. Then there's Benegal. Among 
                        <br>
                        Hollywood film makers, there's Woody Allen, Coppolla&#8230; 
                        I like the 'dark humor' in western films.&quot;<br> <br>
                        Any regrets in life? &quot;Yes. An Old Bhagavathar from 
                        Kalpathy would come to teach me and my brother music. 
                        But I would speak off to play cricket. I wish I had learnt 
                        classical music. I missed out on a very good opportunity.&quot;<br> 
                        <br>
                        So what does Shyamaprasad do to fulfill this earnest desire? 
                        &quot;I'm composing music these days using computer software. 
                        I'm learning more about music, because it is one of the 
                        most important components in a film.&quot;<br> <br>
                        Was film making a dream he cherished? &quot;Not exactly. 
                        Back in school and in college, I used to write plays. 
                        As I wasn't keen on stage performances, I would be entrusted 
                        with the costumes and stage settings.&quot;<br> <br>
                        He graduated in theatre arts and did his masters in media 
                        production at the University of Hull, U. K. Back in Kerala, 
                        he served with Doordarshan and graduated to making serials 
                        and then films.<br> <br>
                        He says he is in search of a &quot;resonance&quot; in 
                        films that will reach out to a &quot;discerning audience&quot; 
                        across the globe. &quot;I do not believe in making films 
                        for the sake of money or instant success.&quot;<br></td>
