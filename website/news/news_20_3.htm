                        <p>Oh yes, one or two of them. In very rare circumstances; 
                          like when my friend. Alex Kadavil who passed away recently; 
                          I'd written an article on him. The there is this four 
                          part series in the Mathrubhumi - the Gulf special, about 
                          my experiences in the Middle East.</p>
                        <p><strong>What is the reason for turning to such a medium?</strong></p>
                        <p>(Laughs) No I haven't turned to the medium. I won't 
                          either; they're just making me do it!</p>
                        <p><strong>Oh, is it!</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, I am not a writer. I can't write.</p>
                        <p><strong>So you're not satisfied on that front....</strong></p>
                        <p>It's just that in some particular circumstances I reacted 
                          by writing. I will not attempt to write on my own; an 
                          article I mean</p>
                        <p><strong>What is your first film?</strong></p>
                        <p>Agnisakshi. Kallukondoru Pennu was almost simultaneous. 
                          Its production was held up at various stages, so the 
                          release got delayed.</p>
                        <p><strong>What was your experience working abroad on 
                          films, like in the Gulf?</strong></p>
                        <p>Ah, Manal Nagaram was the first serial on living in 
                          the Gulf. Kallukondoru Oru Pennu was an attempt to show 
                          in the Malayalam mainstream a subject related to the 
                          Gulf War. In comparison, shooting in the Gulf has been 
                          a difficult proposition. 'Cause there are umpteen restrictions; 
                          and in Kallukondoru Pennu we were trying to recreate 
                          the Gulf War. '98 was when we shot the film; and '90 
                          was when the war happened, in '89. You see, in Kuwait 
                          there are several reminders, monuments to the Iraq invasion. 
                          So it is a sensitive subject for them and we had to 
                          deal with their Ministry, their Ministry of Interiors. 
                          The bureaucratic formalities were tremendous. So by 
                          the time we got through, a lot of time had passed. In 
                          the movie, following the war, there's an exodus of refugees 
                          to Jordan, Amman. To create that was very difficult. 
                          But the Malayali community there was very helpful; which 
                          is what made it all possible. Particularly, people like 
                          Sri Suresh Kumar; who were totally devoted to the cause. 
                          So that their experiences in war could be known outside. 
                          Which was interesting; today I think seeing a film like 
                          that would be an ironically interesting aspect. Now, 
                          when the war is in its second episode; there's a lot 
                          of human plight. The irony of the story is such. That 
                          a woman who has come out of a big war, on the scale 
                          of tanks, ammunition etc. faces another humanitarian 
                          war in society - where property, wealth become an issue. 
                          So that is the irony in the tale, which makes it relevant 
                          to today's time.</p>
                        <p><strong>As you said, your Father has influenced you 
                          a lot. What about friends?</strong></p>
                        <p>Oh yes, very much. For me, there isn't a life outside 
                          of my professional life. My friends are those I work 
                          with. So right from Drama School, people who've been 
                          involved with my theatre work, my colleagues when I 
                          was in television - all have always inspired me and 
                          made me do better, each one of them. Now when in cinema, 
                          I maintain a very close relationship with all of them. 
                          So, yeah, professional relationship has enriched me 
                          personally too; and that's something I'm grateful for.</p>
                        <p><strong>Is there anyone else whom you could name as 
                          having influenced you a great deal?</strong></p>
                        <p>So many. If I name just one, it would be unfair. So 
                          many of them, so many.</p>
                        <p><strong>Okay....</strong></p>
                        <p>A lot of actors, directors, technicians, writers, producers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Now shall I ask you a tricky question?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes?</p>
                        <p><strong>Which do you feel is your best work; or is 
                          it yet to come?</strong><br>
