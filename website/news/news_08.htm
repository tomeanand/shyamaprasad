                        The film director, Mr. Shyamaprasad, has sid that it was 
                        never his intention to subscribe to the Hindutva view 
                        through his movie &quot;Agnisakshi&quot;.<br>
                        <br>
                        He was reacting to the controversy over his film &quot;Agnisakshi&quot;, 
                        which won eight awards, including the awards for the best 
                        film and the best director at this year's State Film Awards, 
                        at a meet-the-press programme organized by the Kesari 
                        Memorial Trust her on Saturday.<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;What exactly is Hindutva? If a nilavilakku and poonol 
                        (sacred thread) on screen are what constitute Hindutva. 
                        I am that such a comment has come from someone like P 
                        Govinda Pillai,&quot; he said.<br>
                        <br>
                        He also termed s &quot;unfortunate&quot;, the controversy 
                        over this year's State Film Awards.<br>
                        &quot;The film community, though it is a close group, 
                        seems to be lacking sportsman spirit. When a jury has 
                        been constituted for judging the films, you should be 
                        able to accept their verdict,&quot; he said. Or else, 
                        such criticism should develop into a serious discussion 
                        on cinema rather than a personal grudge campaign.<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Awards are not the last word that qualifies you 
                        as a film maker. Ultimately, it is the people who judge 
                        your movie and your merits as a film maker. This controversy 
                        is silly,&quot; he commented.<br>
                        <br>
                        He also felt that in portraying the film, he had done 
                        justice to the original novel by Mrs. Lalithambika Antharjanam 
                        and that he had not &quot;missed&quot; the radical elements 
                        in the story.<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;This novel should not be clubbed along with novels 
                        such as &quot;Adukkalayil Ninnu Arangathekku&quot; or 
                        &quot;Rithumathi&quot;, which belong to the renaissance 
                        period of Malayalam literature. More than the sociological 
                        perspective, the novel has certain universal elements 
                        which transcend time - this story could take place in 
                        any community. &quot;It is about certain essential moral 
                        values of man, and his confrontations with fate. It is 
                        very spiritual in essence - this does not mean that it 
                        stems from a particular religion. It is these timeless 
                        values which I have tried to portray in my film&quot;, 
                        Mr. Shyamaprasad said.<br>
                        <br>
                        He said that today, the commercial and entertainment elements 
                        that had to be packaged into films for reaching them to 
                        theatres had gone up so much that even for a sensitive, 
                        tender movie like &quot;Agnisakshi&quot;, marketing problems 
                        were terrible. The State Government outfits like Chalachitra 
                        Academy should be able to help serious film makers market 
                        their movies.<br>
                        <br>
                        He said he could not claim himself to be the spokesperson 
                        for either good or popular cinema. &quot;I stand as the 
                        spokesperson for my own films. In the nineties, no film 
                        maker can afford to take a purist stand that he will make 
                        only artistic movies. My work should give me creative 
                        satisfaction, it should uplift me and also give me sufficient 
                        financial backing to get on with my artistic pursuits,&quot; 
                        he said.<br>
                        <br>
                        His future projects? He would love to make a movie based 
                        on Kamala Das's &quot;My Story,&quot; Mr. Shyamaprasad 
                        said.<br></td>
