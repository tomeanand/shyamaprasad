                        Tele-filmmaker Shyamaprasad's foray into the big screen 
                        with Agnisakshi <p>The eternal quest for inner peace, 
                          born out of disillusionment in life, is what Agnisakshi 
                          is all about. Tele film maker Shyamaprasad's maiden 
                          big-screen venture is based on an award- winning novel 
                          of the same name by noted Malayalam writer Lalithambika 
                          Antharjanam. It is the saga of a woman, Devaki, who 
                          rises in revolt from the confines of her decadent society 
                          and her journey to self realization. Through Devaki, 
                          the film also seeks to explore the pre-independence 
                          era society of the Nampoodiris, the Brahmins of Kerala.<br>
                          <br>
                          Agnisakshi unfolds through the reminiscences of Thangam 
                          Nair (Praveena). During a pilgrimage to Hardwar, she 
                          meets Sumithrananda, a sanyasin, played by Shobhana, 
                          who evokes memories of her long lost teenage friend 
                          Devaki, called Thethi in Nampoothiri parlance. The sanyasin 
                          refuses to recognize Thangam.<br>
                          <br>
                          Thangam remembers Thethi as the wife of the gentle and 
                          spiritually inclined Unni (Rajit Kapoor) of Manampalli 
                          Illom, a Namboodiri household. Apphan Nampoothiri (Madampu 
                          Kunjukuttan), the elder brother of Unni, symbolized 
                          the authoritarian patriarchy of the era. The women in 
                          the family were confined to the dark corridors of the 
                          illam. Thethi, too, was spared. Her only solace was 
                          Thangam, Apphan's daughter in his relationship with 
                          a Nair woman.<br>
                          <br>
                          Those were the years when several reformists within 
                          the society came forward to liberate the Namboodiri 
                          women. Thethi, unhappy with her life in the illam, left 
                          her marital home to join one of these movements. Meanwhile, 
                          Thangam married a wealthy Nair youth and set up home 
                          in north India. She would often hear of Devaki Manampalli, 
                          the reformist and freedom fighter, and knew it was her 
                          friend Thethi. The next stage in Thethi's quest was 
                          Gandhiku's ashram where she became Devi behan; she soon 
                          left the place following some bitter experience. In 
                          search of elusive tranquility, she embraced sanyaas 
                          and became Sumithrananda to set up ashram at Hardwar.<br>
                          <br>
                          Unni, who spent the rest of his days in solitude studying 
                          scriptures, had all the while preserved Thethi's mangalsutra 
                          as a reminder of their short matrimony. This, before 
                          dying, he had handed over to Thangam asking her to give 
                          it to Thethi or if unable to trace her, immerse it in 
                          the Ganga.<br>
                          <br>
                          The film reverts from the flash back when Sumithrananda 
                          receives Thangam in her ashram and accepts the mangallsutra. 
                          She melts the gold in fire, a sing of atonement, and 
                          gives it to Thangam's granddaughter.<br>
                          <br>
                          The film, which was recently premiered at the 51 day-long 
                          Surya Twentieth anniversary film, video, dance and music 
                          festival at Thiruvananthapuram, has been faithful to 
                          the novel in following the same sequence of events, 
                          flashbacks and almost the same dialogues. More importantly, 
                          the film accomplishes a better and detailed treatment 
                          of Unni by highlighting the thematic preoccupation of 
                          the novel-spiritual quest over materialistic pursuits.<br>
                          <br>
                          By choosing a popular novel of the 70s, much acclaimed 
                          for its theme than craft, as the plot for his first 
                          big screen venture, Shyamaprasad has to some extent 
                          succeeded in kindling the curiosity of the viewers, 
                          especially those familiar with the novel. But this also 
                          makes him prone to scrutiny and criticism.<br>
                          <br>
                          Though conforming to the novel is commendable, it seems 
                          to deprive the film of new thematic explorations and 
                          prevents the director, whose Malayalam telefilms Nilavariyunnu 
                          and Uyirthezhunnelppu have won international acclaim, 
                          from experimenting with the craft. Also, the few songs 
                          in the film seem out of place.<br>
                          <br>
                          Azhakappan's camera makes the film a visual treat by 
                          absorbing the dim-lit interiors which effectively symbolize 
                          the period in which the story is set.<br>
                          <br>
                          Scripted by Shyamaprasad himself, the film offers ample 
                          insight into the characters, their worldly struggles 
                          and their efforts to find peace within. </p></td>
