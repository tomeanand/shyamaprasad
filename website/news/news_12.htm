                        It took over 10 years for cinema lovers to get the taste 
                        of talented movie-maker, R. Shyamaprasad's abilities since 
                        his first telefilm in 1987.<br> <br>
                        Nevertheless Shyamaprasad has always been comfortable 
                        with what he has been doing for the last many years, namely 
                        tele film-making. His first effort on the big screen Agnisakshi 
                        had received as much praise as he had got from the work 
                        done for the television media. His first movie, which 
                        was based on a famous Malayalam Novel under the same name 
                        Agnisakshi, has won many awards in the State and national 
                        level, not to mention about the recognition from other 
                        private film bodies.<br> <br>
                        The story of Agnisakshi was a familiar and famous one. 
                        And there was no need for convincing anybody about the 
                        possibilities of making it into a good film. 'And as far 
                        as I am concerned I have tried to be as sincere as I can 
                        to the story and not made any changes,' says Shyamaprasad, 
                        who was in Chennai to award for best debut director.<br> 
                        <br>
                        But, for a person like him, the medium of cinema was not 
                        easy to adopt as he had been working on television projects 
                        without making much compromises and he never viewed it 
                        as a big business proposition.<br> <br>
                        In cinema, one has to think of the commercial side and 
                        the possibilities of getting back the invested sum. This 
                        is not so with telefilms. Elaborating on it, he refers 
                        to the movie-makers an states that the directors are forced 
                        to make compromises'.<br> <br>
                        They have to think of the audience and distributors and 
                        all others connected with the industry before taking the 
                        plunge. However, he says that both cinema and television 
                        are creative media and that there is no doubt about it.<br> 
                        <br>
                        Further dwelling into the subject, he explains: 'In film-making 
                        you will have to interact with more number of people and 
                        hold discussions about the theme and the ideas'.<br> <br>
                        'The people in the field may have different ideas and 
                        styles. As you start interacting with these people at 
                        different levels, you end up making compromises. And no 
                        director can escape from this'.<br>
                        On his style of functioning, Shyamaprasad says he does 
                        not work solely for the benefit of getting any award. 
                        'I love to bring in more crowds and my target audience 
                        is definitely not the ones who watch only art movies' 
                        he says.<br> <br>
                        After making quite a lot of successful telefilm in the 
                        past, his entry into the film world itself had made news 
                        sometime back. Besides Agnisakshi, Shyamaprasad had also 
                        made another movie in the same period.<br> <br>
                        The film was Kallukondoru Pennu, which has not yet been 
                        released. Making it big in the world of movies is certainly 
                        not going to make him stay away from television. 'I am 
                        working on some new projects for a private channel and 
                        another movie project is also in the pipeline' he discloses.<br>
                        The director, who has been making movies close to real 
                        life, has very limited number of favorite Indian directors. 
                        Like Shyam Bengal and among Malayalam directors, Padmarajan 
                        is my favorite' he says.<br> <br>
                        'There should be some realism in a movie and I will not 
                        make anything that is run-of-the mill stuff'. Turning 
                        to Agnisakshi, he says he would not work on another movie 
                        like that, particularly with the same back ground.<br> 
                        <br>
                        A student of School of Drama, this 8-year old son of BJP 
                        leader, O. Rajagopal, from Palakkad had been striking 
                        it on his own since he joined Doordarshan, Thiruvananthapuram, 
                        way back in the 80s.<br> <br>
                        Though his famous telefilms including Nilaavu Ariyunnu 
                        had won a prestigious award in Germany he preferred to 
                        come out of the clutches of premier television channel 
                        in search of creative freedom. Being the son of a BJP 
                        leader had also landed him in some controversies. Brushing 
                        aside the allegations of influence of his father in getting 
                        him awards, he says that his father has nothing to do 
                        with his work. Just because my father is a BJP man, it 
                        does not prevent me from taking up my job seriously. He 
                        is vehement when he says that.<br> <br>
                        Shyamaprasad and his cameraman friend, Alagappan, now 
                        run a film, Shoot N Edit' in Thiruvananthapuram. Almost 
                        all the work done by Shyamaprasad has been photographed 
                        by Alagappan.<br> <br>
                        Reminiscing on his past, Shyamaprasad says that after 
                        completing his course in School of Drama, he went to England 
                        and studied cinematography in the University of Hull, 
                        and then went on to make more than a dozen of telefilms 
                        like Venalinte Ozhivu, Peruvazhiyile Kariyila, Viswavikhyathamaya 
                        Mooku, Uyirthezhunelppu, Niramillatha Chitrangal to name 
                        a few. He has been doing well ever since.<br> <br>
                        With numerous projects on hand, he can not afford to disappoint 
                        his well-wishers and with his professionalism he should 
                        be making less compromise.<br></td>
