                        of language of the camera, today we see commonly in television 
                        productions the widespread use of long takes, mis en scene 
                        etc. Looking at the differences in the two media - in 
                        theater you have a very limited frame within which you 
                        express emotional possibilities by an actor's movements 
                        on stage - how did you learn of the possibilities when 
                        it came to television? </strong> 
                        <p>Well, it's not like it's 
                          been already decided to have long takes for a particular 
                          scene. Some scenes may be best established in their 
                          real time and space. So that's what guides the approach. 
                          And it's not done as a device to save time, or do tricks 
                          with the camera or as an exercise in mis en scene. Many 
                          a time, there are several scenes I like that are done 
                          with short cut shots. So you see, the choice is decided 
                          by what the moment, the premise of the scene demands.</p>
                        <p><strong>..... But what you say is quite opposed to 
                          this - that of real time and space.</strong></p>
                        <p>You can't really simplify it so, Sunil. To create some 
                          particular meanings montage how it can be effectively 
                          used - Eisenstein has some viewpoints on this. That 
                          dramatization of a moment can be done even in a single 
                          shot. It is the truth deep inside the shot, divinity 
                          that the shot draws its strength from. And not necessarily 
                          an assistance from another shot. So it is the factors 
                          within the frame, the kinetics of its energy that makes 
                          it powerful.</p>
                        <p><strong>Here how important is an actor's contribution? 
                          In the transformation that happens in this space?</strong></p>
                        <p>Very much, in all my theater education works in cinema, 
                          TV - one important factor I value extremely is the contribution 
                          of an actor. Actor and co actors arrive at a truth, 
                          a reality in a moment. More than shock the audience 
                          with a telling I believe in conveying the inner truth, 
                          the inner energy of the moment.</p>
                        <p><strong>So it is really the language of theatre that 
                          holds good in all situations?</strong></p>
                        <p>Almost, theatricality is an attribute of any work of 
                          art. Take a painting for example; Shakuntala plucking 
                          a thorn from her foot; it is the drama of the moment 
                          that captivates the viewer. It sets off echoes within.</p>
                        <p><strong>Is it the success of Uyirthezhunnelpu that 
                          encouraged you to give up theatre and migrate wholly 
                          to cinema?</strong></p>
                        <p>Well, can't say that is the only thing. 'Cause when 
                          I was in Drama School even; my projects play too; many 
                          said it was more suited to the cinematic medium; with 
                          a realistic flavor that's found in cinema. So probably 
                          my basic instincts lie in the medium of cinema. Drama 
                          is just a means for achieving this.</p>
                        <p><strong>If that's the case, what would be a school 
                          of Drama that has influenced you the most?</strong></p>
                        <p>I don't know; in our experience; in Kerala's Drama 
                          history, aprt from our regional style of drama, a strong 
                          infunce of any other school is missing. Like for e.g. 
                          Realism, many types of stylization such as Theatre of 
                          the absurd or expressionistic theatre - none of these 
                          have clearly left a mark on our theatre. Many isolated 
                          instances are there; so I cannot say that a particular 
                          school has influenced me. But I have been drawn to many 
                          works in theatre, such as Anton Chekhov, American realists 
                          such as Tennessee Williams, Eugene O' Neil, Ibsen. These 
                          are my favorite writers. I guess that's an indication 
                          of my taste.</p>
                        <p><strong>In theatre, we had a trend of Ibsenites once.</strong></p>
                        <p>Well as an institution I don't think you'd find one. 
                          'Cause to call our professional drama scene 'realistic' 
                          would be inappropriate. Not in any way. It's probably 
                          the inputs of N Krishna Pillai that have resulted in 
                          a 'sukhadita' drama style. That too however, hasn't 
                          quite become a school in itself.</p>
                        <p><strong>Another notable thing I've observed is that 
                          even on coming to the visual medium, you've always attempted 
                          to draw strength from literature. What is the reason 
                          for such an influence?</strong></p>
                        <p>I am not a storyteller; not capable of creating a story. 
                          So my attention is not towards making a story; as a 
                          film maker. My efforts are towards visualizing, giving 
                          cinematic form to a tale that I'd like for its sincerity, 
                          that I would want to tell. So finding a good story does 
                          a great job in this. Then I can concentrate on my work. 
                          So to get a strong base is essential to a film; as a 
                          premise. So we'd identify with works which touch us 
                          as real, make me feel a part of the moment - I feel 
                          it's a reflection of myself. To make a film out of this 
                          has been my effort so far. Sometime later, I might have 
                          a story written all by myself; but at the moment I'm 
                          not concentrating on that area.</p></td>
