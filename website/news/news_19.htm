                        <em><strong>Welcome to Deep Focus.</strong></em><br> <br>
                        There was a time when Malayalam cinema drew its strength 
                        and content from the wealth of its Malayalam literature. 
                        But then for a long time, it was as though Malayalam cinema 
                        forgot literature. Later people like Bharatan and Padmarajan 
                        brought this connection back between the two. Then again, 
                        the divide persisted for a while. In the recent past, 
                        director Shyamaprasad has been at the forefront in mining 
                        this richness of Malayalam literature and bringing it 
                        to celluloid. In his works we see a beautiful blend of 
                        the written word and the visual medium. Today we have 
                        with us in Deep Focus, director Shyamaprasad sharing his 
                        creative perspective, personal viewpoints, and experiences. 
                        We welcome him to this edition of Deep Focus. 
                        <p><strong>Shyam, you are a product of Drama School. But 
                          not many are aware of your work in theatre, or your 
                          contribution to this medium. So could we begin with 
                          a note on that?</strong></p>
                        <p>(Laughs) Well that's probably because there hasn't 
                          been much of a contribution! Anyway, after learning 
                          direction from Drama School, I did a play named 'Laura' 
                          for the Cult - a repertory theatre group of the Calicut 
                          University, in '82. It was based on 'Glass Menagerie' 
                          by Tennessee Williams. The play was shown widely in 
                          Kerala. Later while based in Delhi, this was before 
                          joining Doordarshan; I did a few more plays - Chekhov's 
                          works, among others. There was a theatre group called 
                          'Thiranottam' in Delhi staging Malayalam plays.</p>
                        <p>After joining DD, for the same Cult I did 'Moscow 1906' 
                          based on The Just by Albert Camus - which was to later 
                          become Uyirthezhunnelpu - it was the same cast, the 
                          same theme, the same pattern. There was another production, 
                          Midi Theatre in Ernakulam (later to become Living Theatre); 
                          for them I did Woody Allen's 'The Death'. And that was 
                          my last so-called theatre production.</p>
                        <p><strong>But surprisingly, you have carried over the 
                          same works into your television career too. Now obviously 
                          there's a difference in the visual language used in 
                          these two media - it appears you were the first to attempt 
                          this crossover into a more technically advanced, electronic 
                          medium. How did you manage to bring about such a change 
                          - that too with the same cast, the same people involved?</strong></p>
                        <p>When we choose a play to stage, we are touched by its 
                          fundamental premise, its context, the characters, its 
                          moments, the dialogues - these intrinsic merits are 
                          what impress us the most and remain even after the production. 
                          And when we move to another medium, we are inspired 
                          to express these very impressions, these thoughts. And 
                          so, it wasn't the structure of theatre, or its format 
                          that I carried over from my Drama school upbringing 
                          or my theatre productions. On looking back, what I really 
                          transplanted from my theatre education was a reading 
                          of prominent theatre works, an interest in the human 
                          condition, in its myriad moments; how to make acting 
                          appear more natural, engaging and suchlike.</p>
                        <p>So as I see it, there wasn't anything deliberate, anything 
                          forced in the transition. From Camus' The Just, staged 
                          as 'Moscow 1906' in 1995; to the television production 
                          Uyirthezhunnelpu in 1996 the transformation was very 
                          natural, quite effortless.</p>
                        <p><strong>But for you, on crossing over to another medium, 
                          the picture would be very clear in your mind wouldn't 
                          it, 'cause these emotions, these thoughts are at the 
                          back of your mind, - But for the actors Murali, Kukku 
                          Parameswaran, Murugan - these are people who are trained 
                          in theatre - did you have a difficulty in converting 
                          them to a cinematic language?</strong></p>
                        <p>Well no, if you look at it all as reality recorded 
                          within the frame of a camera - which is the language 
                          of cinema; it is intended that people behave naturally, 
                          as they would normally do. But in this play, the premise 
                          itself was a little stylized. And since the premise 
                          was derived on ideological leanings; (it was a solid 
                          premise), it has an innate stylization - which has perhaps 
                          seeped into the telefilm. I haven't sidelined this aspect 
                          entirely. In some instances, I do see flaws which are 
                          probably due to the actors, actresses being from a theatre 
                          background, my own education in theatre too - all this 
                          has affected the film in some of its moments. I'm not 
                          sure whether a complete transplantation has worked here. 
                          But that is mainly because I wasn't bothered about a 
                          transplantation. It was all an unconscious process of 
                          translating the essential thought into a language of 
                          the camera.</p></td>
