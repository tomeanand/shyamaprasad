                        The selection of Agnisakshi for eight state film awards 
                        sparks bitter accusations of religious and political bias 
                        <p> Unlike its southern neighbours, the Kerala film industry 
                          has largely kept aloof from he messy world of politics. 
                          But there's always a first time. Last week, the announcement 
                          of the state film awards triggered a major row, with 
                          senior leaders of the CPI (M) which heads the ruling 
                          left Democratic Front Government in Kerala seeing shades 
                          of saffron in the grating of eight wards to the film 
                          Agnisakshi; their grouse was that the film glorifies 
                          spiritualism and Hindutva.<br>
                          <br>
                          The charge may not have stuck but for the fact that 
                          award winning film has been directed by R. Shyamaprasad, 
                          an acclaimed tele-film maker who also happens to be 
                          the son of O. Rajagopal, Rajya Sabha MP and all-India 
                          vice president of the BJP. The CPI(M) leaders are naturally 
                          seething with rage.<br>
                          <br>
                          What rankles them further is that Gershome, the film 
                          that came second, was directed by P. T. Kunjumuhammed, 
                          a CPI(M) backed MLA, who has now charged Shaji N. Karun, 
                          renowned film maker and head of the state Chalachitra 
                          Akademi - which selects the jury - with bias. &quot;Shaji 
                          has conspired to give Agnisakshi the awards to be in 
                          the good books of the BJP-led Government at the Centre,&quot; 
                          &quot;My film is definitely spiritual but not in a parochial, 
                          religious sense&quot; he claims. The soft-spoken Shaji, 
                          a national award winning cinematographer and director, 
                          has dismissed the allegations as &quot;unfortunate.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Kunjumuhammed, however, has found support from CPI(M) 
                          leaders likeP.Govinda Pillai,the party's state committee 
                          member who is also chairman of the Kerala State Film 
                          Development Corporation. Stung by the attack from his 
                          own party colleagues, state Culture Minister T. K. Ramakrishnan 
                          clarified: &quot;The Government has no complaints about 
                          the film.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Shyamaprasad, whose telefilms have won many laurels, 
                          including a special jury prize at the Golden Chest TV 
                          Fest held in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, has been forced to come 
                          out in defense of his film. &quot;My film is definitely 
                          spiritual but not in the parochial, religious sense, 
                          he says. To compound matters further, Tapasya, a pro-Sangh 
                          Parivar cultural organization, too has jumped into the 
                          fray, training its guns on both Pillai and Shyamaprasad. 
                          &quot;Pillai has once again betrayed his anti-Hindu 
                          position and Shyamaprasad his cowardice when he said 
                          that his film's spirituality has no religious content,&quot; 
                          it said in a statement.<br>
                          <br>
                          Agnisakshi, which won awards for best film, direction, 
                          camera, best actor, supporting actress, sound, make-up 
                          and dubbing, is based on a celebrated and partly autobiographical 
                          novel of the same name by the late Lalithambika Antharjanam. 
                          Agnisakshi narrates the saga of Thethikutty, a girl 
                          from a liberal Namboodiri family who marries Unni, a 
                          conservative but good-at-heart person. Unable to bear 
                          life within the four walls of her home, Thethikutty 
                          runs away and joins the national movement. But after 
                          Independence, disillusionment sets in and she turns 
                          to spiritualism and becomes a sanyasin in Hardwar.<br>
                          <br>
                          While the novel highlights the cloistered and ritual-ridden 
                          Namboodiri life in order to denounce it, critics of 
                          the film say that Agnisakshi uses these very scenes 
                          without being too critical. &quot;Shyamaprasad has deliberately 
                          downplayed the radical portions of the novel and highlighted 
                          the alleged spirituality,&quot; maintains Pillai.<br>
                          <br>
                          The flipside to the whole controversy is that it has 
                          evoked public interest in the film which distributors 
                          considered too &quot;arty&quot; and would not touch. 
                          However, it is the kind of publicity Shyamaprasad could 
                          do without. He has pleased that he should not be made 
                          to pay the price for his father's politics. But knowing 
                          the CPI (M)'s antipathy to anything and anyone even 
                          remotely linked to the BJP or its ideology, this appears 
                          unlikely.</p></td>
