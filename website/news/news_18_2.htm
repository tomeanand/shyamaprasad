                        Agnisakshi</strong><br> <br>
                        Agnisakshi, the novel had gripped me when I first read 
                        it - the way of life in the Namboodiri household, their 
                        outlook, the society then - it had captivated me. The 
                        story had the stature and expanse to stand up and be counted 
                        among the best literary works ever, internationally. Then, 
                        while at DD, I had occasion to know Lalithambika and family 
                        closely, thanks to producer Saajan. And so I could meet 
                        the grand old lady, speak to her, know her first hand. 
                        And the association remains an enduring one, an intimate 
                        attachment which I treasure. <p>Back then, we toyed with 
                          the idea of making a telefilm. Not exactly a 'serial'; 
                          rather a film in many parts; this was at the time that 
                          my telefilm 'Uyirthezhunnelpu' was completed. And so 
                          I wrote a screenplay on Agnisakshi. But I felt something 
                          was amiss then - you see, the entire narrative of Agnisakshi 
                          is situated in a memory; it's the stuff of a flashback. 
                          And when you make it 'episodic', break it up into many 
                          parts - you lose the tautness that connects the past 
                          and the present. I realized this even as I wrote the 
                          script -that the story simply did not lend itself to 
                          an 'episodic' format.</p>
                        <p>Thus it came about that Agnisakshi had to be a full 
                          length end-to-end film - that alone would be a structure 
                          true to its narrative. At the time I delved deep into 
                          the subject, made enquiries, did some research too. 
                          I'd passed on the novel to AV Babu, Dr N B Prasad; they 
                          were both drawn to the storyline; attracted to its theme, 
                          its inherent strength. And so we decided to make film 
                          out of it.</p>
                        <p>I tend to think that it is essentially the strength, 
                          the divinity in Agnisakshi that held such appeal and 
                          resulted in the audience liking it.</p>
                        <p><strong>On casting</strong><br>
                          <br>
                          Well, casting was always going to be difficult. You 
                          see, the narrative happens at two points of time, is 
                          set in two ages, two viewpoints really. It's a story 
                          of two families, set in different eras. The 'story within 
                          a story' begins with Thankam's childhood - Sreevidya 
                          plays the grown up Thankam, who's actually looking back 
                          in time. While on a pilgrimage to Hardwar, the old woman 
                          is thrown into a recollection - here's the movie's starting 
                          point, in terms of filmic narrative.</p>
                        <p>But then, beginning the movie-telling with a young 
                          girl, say fifteenish - carrying forth until she reaches 
                          old age; and then cut back to her past - this sequence 
                          did not seem to be a credible one. The persona the viewer 
                          encounters first in the cinema needs to be strong enough, 
                          well-etched so to speak, to lead the story. Else, we'd 
                          have a weak narrative, based on an ill-defined characterization.</p>
                        <p>And so we split it into two characters. Here's Shobhana 
                          leading the viewer through a sequence, in real-time, 
                          of her life. So we see her, first as a young woman, 
                          then a sanyasin, and eventually in graceful old age. 
                          There's a natural time progression, easier for the viewer 
                          to grasp.</p>
                        <p>When we split the character delineation, we have an 
                          emotional intensity that the character conveys, a reaching 
                          out to the viewer. Had, in the end, the old woman been 
                          played by another actress than Shobhana, the flow would've 
                          been upset.</p>
                        <p>So you see, there were such complex challenges when 
                          it came to casting. I found there's only one way out 
                          - it's a work of art, on an imaginary plane. We expected 
                          a 'willing suspension of disbelief' from the audience. 
                          And going by the response we've had I think it's been 
                          effective. Of course, looking at rationally, there's 
                          this issue of one character played by two women, two 
                          actresses - unlike all other characters in the film. 
                          This has been brought up by some; but at a purely emotional 
                          level, I think this has worked towards keeping the narrative 
                          unaffected.</p></td>
