                        on the aspect of Indian music; where ragas have this concept 
                        of 'rasa' (meaning mood) evocative in the songs - you 
                        haven't delved into it yet? </strong> 
                        <p>Well I haven't looked 
                          into it yet and how to use it in cinema. But mainly 
                          the harmony based orchestral arrangement is what blends 
                          better in the visual medium I think. This is certainly 
                          not a conceptual decision, simply what I've observed 
                          from experience. So yes, on Indian ragas and the moods 
                          they evoke - it is possible to develop a viewpoint on 
                          this. And there are many leading lights in this domain 
                          too.</p>
                        <p><strong>You were in DD for a long time. So was it the 
                          problem of being in an 'official' position that led 
                          you to quit DD - so as to give freer rein to your creativity?</strong></p>
                        <p>It's been a long time; when you talk of it; it feels 
                          like the wound hasn't yet healed; </p>
                        <p><strong>So it was a wound, eh?</strong></p>
                        <p>Yeah, naturally. But later when I came to reflect on 
                          it - in any government situation, there is this theory 
                          of averages. You can't hold on to the system if you 
                          are either above or below this average. If you are just 
                          average you can go along with the boat. The system expects 
                          a particular working pattern, some restrictions that 
                          come along with it.. You can't go below or above it. 
                          You need not contribute more than that or less than 
                          that. So I guess, (laughs) I couldn't meet the theory 
                          of averages. Maybe I was lesser than that.</p>
                        <p><strong>So on a scale, you found you couldn't.....</strong></p>
                        <p>Right, I couldn't measure up on that scale. It is good 
                          for me also; for them too that I've dropped out; so 
                          that I can contribute more.</p>
                        <p><strong>Anyways, if it's a wound, let's try to out 
                          it behind us entirely</strong></p>
                        <p>Fine by me; I just put it figuratively.</p>
                        <p><strong>Another question about working on a foreign 
                          production; 'cause though the producer of 'Bokshu' is 
                          an Indian, many technicians, actors and crew were from 
                          abroad. The film was also shot abroad. So this experience 
                          of working abroad - how would you compare this with 
                          that of shooting a film back home, with our crew, among 
                          our people?</strong></p>
                        <p>The most fundamental difference I see, well, there 
                          may be exceptions in Western films too; is that the 
                          whole thing gets started on a script. You need a script 
                          to begin with anything. Even to talk to an actor; you 
                          need a script; he has to have a script to read. There 
                          isn't this idea of 'narrating' a story at all. The director 
                          doesn't need to give a performance of the story; there 
                          is no 'pitching' by the director. You need a clear script; 
                          as to what is happening, what is the dialogue. Based 
                          on this, they have a meticulously planned manner of 
                          production. Extremely. Now with the crew and technicians 
                          of foreigners, when we shot it here in India, we achieved 
                          close to something like 70 % of that pattern. But it 
                          was when we shot in Los Angeles that I fully realized 
                          the result of this working - 100 %.</p>
                        <p>If for example, we feel the need to have a little matchstick 
                          in a corner of the set, then it would be precisely there. 
                          Provided of course, you plan for it. You plan it on 
                          the script; with a very detailed storyboard and shot 
                          list. It is a great game of planning; in which you can 
                          achieve anything you want. The technical perfection, 
                          flawlessness that we see in Western films, a kind of 
                          naturalness - isn't something that comes by chance. 
                          It is all very detailed planning and execution at work.</p>
                        <p><strong>But our people say that such planning involves 
                          a great deal of work, it's very difficult, causes financial 
                          overheads and so on; hence not quite suited to our setup. 
                          We could well do it, but it is not quite suited to our 
                          setup.</strong></p>
                        <p>I don't agree to that. I'm not talking about great 
                          special effects or huge sets. I'm talking detail here. 
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Details, huh..</strong></p>
                        <p>Researching on the details; and a mindset, an attitude 
                          to recreate them, a working culture - that is important. 
                          Which I'm sad to say is lacking in us.</p>
                        <p><strong>You mean about planning....</strong></p>
                        <p>Everyone would know what I'm referring to. Here a script 
                          is ready often at the last moment. Nobody has a clue 
                          what is to be done, what is to be said. In the morning, 
                          the director may say, today we need a bullock cart for 
                          the shoot. So a guy goes looking for one. By then the 
                          best lighting condition for a cameraman may well be 
                          lost. At 10 am the cameraman comes, shoots it in top 
                          light. So everywhere there is a deterioration of quality 
                          and intent.</p>
                        <p><strong>There is no professionalism, no planning...</strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, that's a great lesson to be learnt from them, 
                          in working wit their crew.</p>
                        <p><strong>On the subject of interacting with western 
                          units - among technicians, of course the director needs 
                          to be in sync with the cameraman; but you'd interact 
                          most with the actors, right. How was it like interacting 
                          with the foreign actors?</strong></p>
                        <p>As I said earlier, one thing that profoundly affects 
                          the production is the quality of sound recording. Actors 
                          must study their lines in the scene. They should have 
                          them by-heart. They would come in the morning, with 
                          the scene well studied. Then, I'll tell you an instance 
                          of how we'd typically do a shot - we'd commence a shoot 
                          like this - supposing a scene is to be shot; I talk 
                          to the cameraman and say, 'Well, here's a scene like 
                          this where the actor comes in from there opening the 
                          door. There is a greeting on entering; and so we have 
                          a dialogue.' I explain thus to the cameraman and he 
                          says, okay so let's set it up. This is totally unlike 
                          how they would do it.</p>
                        <p>You have to enact the whole scene to them. The actors 
                          and the director 'block' the entire scene. The scene 
                          is shot as a 'master' - which conveys the flow, lighting 
                          continuity - if for example, in the course of the scene 
                          one of the actors walks to the window, there'd need 
                          to be a light source there. So when we take this first 
                          shot, the cameraman knows exactly what's going to happen 
                          in the seventh shot. Everybody is thorough as to what 
                          is totally happening on the scene, what is the total 
                          dynamism of the scene. How the scene grows, how the 
                          acting grows. It is fundamentally important for an actor, 
                          the technical crew and the director that we have the 
                          full picture, in detail, of the scene.</p>
                        <p><strong>So you're saying planning is very important; 
                          when a scene is enacted all actors, co-actors need to 
                          be there</strong></p>
                        <p>Certainly, and quite unlike the practice here, because 
                          we take sound live.</p></td>
