                      <td colspan="2" valign="top" class="txtNews"> Some of these 
                        weaknesses may be traced to Shyamaprasad's background 
                        as was learnt while talking to him recently in Chennai. 
                        Trained in theatre at Trichur's School of Drama and later 
                        at the Film and Television Institute in Pune, this young 
                        director worked in Doordarshan before traveling to Britain, 
                        where he got a master's degree in media studies. Even 
                        there, it was drama that engaged most of his attention. 
                        However, when he returned to India, he made several television 
                        shorts and advertisement campaigns. One mentionable highlight 
                        is &quot;Nilavu Ariyunnu&quot;, a 45 minute feature.<br> <br>
                        But what was it that attracted him to a fairly heavy subject 
                        like &quot;Agnisakshi&quot;? &quot;I read the novel about 
                        15 years ago, and for almost a decade, I had been toying 
                        with the idea of filming it. The hopelessness of destiny 
                        or fate in one's life was what drew me to this literary 
                        masterpiece. Although I am not a Namboodiri, I can very 
                        well conceptualize a situation where two people who have 
                        different views of dharma have to live together. This 
                        dilemma is the soul of the novel. The social issues in 
                        it form a mere icing to this man woman conflict. I personally 
                        feel that Antharjanam's book is no social commentary of 
                        the period. It transcends that. The tale could have taken 
                        place at anytime, anywhere&#8230;<br> <br>
                        But to a viewer who has not read the printed version, 
                        Shyamaprasad's point of concern hardly seems to have got 
                        itself translated on to the screen. The maker disagrees 
                        with this. &quot;I have tried to keep the period out of 
                        focus. I have attempted to put Unni and Devaki on the 
                        centre of the stage. Of course, I have verbalized a lot 
                        of it.&quot;<br> <br>
                        But it is the relationship between Thankam and Devaki 
                        that catches one's attention. Shyamaprasad reflects hard, 
                        and admits, &quot;May be so. Thankam is a very important 
                        character, true. She is the one who narrates the story. 
                        She is also a participant. It is from her perspective, 
                        through, through her eyes, that one has to look at the 
                        delicate nuances between the husband and the wife.&quot; 
                        But, somewhere, the balance appears to have tilted rather 
                        uncomfortably towards the &quot;sutradar.&quot;<br> <br>
                        The victim of this has been Shobhana. Her role leaves 
                        a lot to be desired. &quot;I agree I have not tried documenting 
                        Devaki's (Shobhana) life. The dramatic structure does 
                        not follow her. It traces Thankam's observations of Devaki's 
                        existence, how Unni's life completes a full circle. It 
                        is wasted in meaningless rituals. Devaki feels the same 
                        about herself. The picture, in the end, says how two people 
                        lived without understanding each other.&quot;<br> <br>
                        Moving away from 'Agnisakshi' Shyamaprasad feels in the 
                        course of random reflections that &quot;modern cinema 
                        is obsessed by the graphic form. I do not think that it 
                        needs to be a particularly graphic medium. Words can be 
                        used powerfully and penetratingly to convey depth and 
                        complexity inhuman emotions and relationships. Talking 
                        is part of the human action, and it is necessary in this 
                        medium.&quot;<br> <br>
                        But what about songs? &quot;I agree they are an artificial 
                        element. As far as my film goes. I have admittedly made 
                        certain compromises. I wish I had avoided the songs. But 
                        I am certain they have not marred the soul of &quot;Agnisakshi&#8230;&quot; 
                        the director avers.<br>
                        Shyamaprasad's effort could have made a greater impact 
                        without these give-and-takes, but it is one thing making 
                        a movie and quite another trying to sell it. The dilemma 
                        can be unnerving.<br> </td>
