                        <br>
                        The other surprise is the Bengali serial, Stopper, with 
                        a subject which is utterly Bengali, but treated in an 
                        unusual way to make it a gripping study of character, 
                        of generation gap, and the football mania. The director 
                        is Indranil Goswami and the lead actor is Debesh Roy Choudhary. 
                        Many fiction football films have been made by the Germans 
                        and the Hungarians, to name only two countries. Stopper 
                        can hold its own against all of them. It is taut, the 
                        football sequences are excellently shot and edited, the 
                        sound and camera work are outstanding.<br> <br>
                        There is a bravura performance by Debesh Roy Choudhary, 
                        who makes us believe that he can really play first class 
                        football. As in the Malayalam film, it is the characters 
                        which revolve round football mania, who provide value.<br> 
                        <br>
                        Roy Choudhary is the stopper who is not informed by his 
                        ambitious coach manager that his wife is seriously ill 
                        so that his performance in the match is not affected. 
                        When he arrives home after two days, his wife is dead. 
                        And his anger with the coach is only matched by his anguish 
                        at his little son's accusation and subsequent estrangement 
                        over his not coming in time for his wife's death.<br> 
                        <br>
                        As the boy grows, his abhorrence for his football-crazy 
                        father is only matched by his hate of football, jogging 
                        and other signs of sports. This clash of personality leads 
                        up to a tender denouement, done without any suggestion 
                        of mawkishness. This again is a class serial.<br> <br>
                        And when I try to think of anything from Bombay to match 
                        during the last year, amidst a lot of rubbish, I can only 
                        think of the serials by Vikas Desai and Gulzar, which 
                        also got away from sex-violence and filmi gimmicks to 
                        let us have a slice of real, credible life, done with 
                        compassion as well as professionalism. 
                        <p>TELECAST REGIONAL SERIALS IN DELHI<br>
                          <br>
                          I can only suggest that now that NFDC has a super sub 
                          titling machine, and the DG of Doordarshan is its chairperson, 
                          that we - at least in Delhi and Bombay - get a chance 
                          to see these outstanding regional serials and that Sunday 
                          afternoon is not merely devoted to films, that too only 
                          in Hindi. International and national audiences in the 
                          Capital simply long for serials such as these, which 
                          have high quality and genuine human values, with English 
                          translations.<br>
                          <br>
                          I return again this week to the question of cable operators 
                          playing fair. After the return of ATN, I have ceased 
                          to get BITV and for those without extra gadgets, required 
                          for getting reception of DD's channel 3, there seems 
                          no option but to watch other channels, and operators 
                          are still not giving the CNN India service.<br>
                          <br>
                          At the recent cable operators' meet, with International 
                          delegates and all the big channels represented, Bhaskar 
                          Ghose, the secretary of the ministry of Information 
                          and Broadcasting said he would protect the smaller cable 
                          operators against the big ones.<br>
                          <br>
                          In that case, why does he not also lay down certain 
                          conditions about their showing the minority channels 
                          as well and not merely the ones laden with filmi muck 
                          and the worst serials? Why should they not play ball 
                          as well?<br>
                          <br>
                          At the moment it seems the small neighborhood operators 
                          are eating their cake and having it too, as DD seems 
                          powerless to even get them to show Channel 3 and CNN 
                          India. What about it, Ghose? We pause for a reply.<br>
                          <br>
                          Tail-Piece: According to the old adage, it is a wise 
                          father who knows his own son. Well, DD seems unable 
                          to know even its own newscasters. In the morning bulletin 
                          in English in November 1, the newscaster was visibly 
                          and audibly. Aninda Chakravarty. But DD's caption named 
                          him as Jitendar Ram Prakash. Even for Doordarshan, one 
                          must confess this was a bit too much.<br>
