                        His creative works are marked by a searing intensity that 
                        can be seen only in a Tarkovsky classic. Accolades for 
                        his genius came from all quarters but the one which really 
                        mattered. And hence, Shyamaprasad, production assistant 
                        at Doordarshan Kendra, Thiruvananthapuram, maker of telefilms 
                        and winner of government and private awards, resigned 
                        his job recently and has set sail on his own.<br> <br>
                        The son of O Rajagopal, national vice-president of the 
                        BJP, Shyamaprasad's qualifications as a TV producer need 
                        no scrutiny. A graduate in theatre direction from Calicut 
                        University's School of Drama, he had a six-month stint 
                        at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), 
                        Pune. He joined DD as production assistant in Bombay and 
                        later came back to his home state with a transfer to Thiruvananthapuram.<br> 
                        <br> &quot;The first three years at Thiruvananthapuram 
                        DD was a period of fun and enthusiasm,&quot; says he. 
                        &quot;I knew that I had an atmosphere which was conducive 
                        for making telefilms, the kind of work I liked.&quot;<br> 
                        <br>
                        His first telefilm Venalinte Ozhivu, based on a short 
                        story by Kamala Das, heralded the arrival of a major talent 
                        on the Indian small screen. Soon after, Shyamaprasad went 
                        on a scholarship to the Hull University in teh UK to study 
                        media and theatre production. Here he got the chance to 
                        work for Yorkshire TV, Channel Four and some centres of 
                        BBC.<br> <br>
                        His return home marked the beginning of his woes with 
                        the authorities. The two-and-a-half years spent abroad 
                        were cut short from his service period. But he persevered 
                        and went on to make telefilms such as Peruvazhiyile Kariyilakal, 
                        Vivaahalochana, Viswavikhyatamaya Mookku, and his masterpiece 
                        Uyirthezhunnelpu.<br> <br>
                        Uyirthezhunnelpu had been produced by DD in 1993 after 
                        its script languished for six years following one rejection 
                        after another. When it won the State awards, the Thiruvananthapuram 
                        Kendra took the stand that as a central government institution; 
                        DD could not accept any award instituted by a government. 
                        Shyamaprasad defied the orders of the Kendra director 
                        forbidding him to accept the award and promptly received 
                        a disciplinary memo. Shortly afterwards, his telefilm 
                        Nilavariyunnu swept the Onida Pinnacle awards, an acknowledgement 
                        of his mastery of the medium at the national level. But 
                        in his office he remained just a production assistant. 
                        &quot;Things had come to such a stage that there was no 
                        meaning in continuing with the job,&quot; Shyamaprasad 
                        says. &quot;My official duty had been reduced to producing 
                        the weekly curtain raiser and not even that in recent 
                        times.&quot; It was not long before he resigned.<br> <br>
                        Despite the treatment meted out to him by it, Shyamaprasad 
                        candidly admits that without DD he would not have been 
                        able to produce his dreams in celluloid such as Uyirthezhunnelpu. 
                        &quot;I do not think any private financier would be willing 
                        to undertake the production of a project like that which 
                        has no guarantee at all of box office returns if made 
                        as a film,&quot; he says. &quot;DD has the power to be 
                        a showcase of good art.&quot;<br> <br>
                        The vagaries of private producers is not new to Shyamaprasad. 
                        His feature film project, Prajapathi, which was to have 
                        featured superstar Mammooty had to be shelved at the last 
                        minute because of distributors developing cold feet over 
                        what they felt was too arty a project. &quot;In future, 
                        I have to smart enough to convince potential producers 
                        and distributors regarding the commercial viability of 
                        my cinema,&quot; he says.<br> <br>
                        That is not all that he has to remember as he gets ready 
                        to switch over from television to the big screen. The 
                        script writer and director in him could face fresh challenges. 
                        Not that he worries over it. &quot;One has to be well 
                        versed in the grammar of both media before making the 
                        transition from one to another,&quot; he says. &quot;I 
                        think I am confident enough to make such a transition,&quot; 
                        he says. Even as he gears up for plunging into the field 
                        of feature films, he nurses a soft corner for his first 
                        love, telefilms. &quot;In the coming years, telefilms 
                        will grow in importance especially for directors who find 
                        it impossible to realize their dream feature film projects, 
                        given the role money plays in them,&quot; he says. He 
                        himself hopes to see none other than DD telecast the telefilms 
                        which he might make in future.<br> <br>
                        Right now, Shyamaprasad is enjoying a serene lull from 
                        work with his wife and children at his house in Thiruvananthapuram. 
                        A lull which people who have known the exquisiteness of 
                        his creations hope, is very brief.<br> </td>
