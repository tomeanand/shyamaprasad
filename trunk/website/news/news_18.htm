                        </strong><br>
                        The quaint ways of the upper caste, male-dominated household 
                        in the Kerala of yesteryears has held a fascination for 
                        artists and writers. Prominent among them was the late 
                        Lalithambika Antherjanam. We have with us a young man 
                        who quit his job at Doordarshan (the state run television 
                        channel) and decided to bring Lalithambika's 'Agnisakshi' 
                        to celluloid. The film was enthusiastically received by 
                        viewers in Kerala who recognized the coming of a fresh 
                        talent. Meet Shyamaprasad, director of Agnisakshi.<br> 
                        <p><strong>On coming into films</strong><br>
                          <br>
                          I was just like any other kid in school; you know the 
                          type that participates in youth festivals, competitions. 
                          Didn't have any exceptional achievements back then . 
                          . . but even way back then, I was more into the setting 
                          up, the organizing than in the actual 'performing'. 
                          When you know, most children just want to perform out 
                          there, on stage. When in Xth standard, I wrote a play 
                          and staged it - got a real kick out of doing it all, 
                          you know the costumes, collecting music pieces . . . 
                          I really agonized over these (tape recorders were pretty 
                          rare those days). And that's what I really enjoy most 
                          - setting up a performance, which is what I'm doing 
                          now.</p>
                        <p>In college I continued in the same vein. But more as 
                          writer/director, than actor. After my Pre-degree, this 
                          seemed to be a natural course to take . . . what with 
                          the Film Institute, the <a href="#" class="txtBlue1" title="National Institute of Drama" target="_blank">NID</a>* 
                          all opening up as avenues. It was around then that Drama 
                          School was started by the Calicut University (for the 
                          first time in Kerala). I simply headed there.</p>
                        <p>It was at Drama School that the world of theatre opened 
                          up to me - it was an in-depth study of the medium; its 
                          history &amp; techniques as they evolved over the years. 
                          And when you're so much into something (it was an intense 
                          3 year course) - in touch with so many artistes, like-minded 
                          people; some of them the leading lights of their time, 
                          such as G Sankara Pillai, S Ramanujan - they were our 
                          teachers then; there was a galaxy of writers, directors, 
                          designers, actors, at both national and international 
                          level - it all really gave one a perspective, a profound 
                          consciousness on theatre.</p>
                        <p>So that's how I came to be in such a medium. Looking 
                          back I hadn't really set out on becoming an artiste; 
                          I mean, I never had such a wish early on. On completing 
                          the course, I wasn't too inclined to pursue theatre 
                          as an 'occupation'. Then, it was rather difficult to 
                          earn a living as a theatre person ... it still is.</p>
                        <p>Fortuitously, it was then that a medium like television 
                          picked up. Trivandrum Doordarshan got started then. 
                          And so again, it seemed the best thing to do next. I 
                          could adapt the lessons I'd learnt in theatre to a medium 
                          like the television. It was while in television that 
                          the stint at Film &amp; Television Institute happened. 
                          And then on, to England where I did my Masters in Media 
                          Production &amp; Film making. Over time I developed 
                          a finer taste for the medium of film-making . . . I'd 
                          like to think that it was all a period of 'experimentation'. 
                          And you know, when you see the results of your efforts 
                          bear fruit - it gives you confidence, and the guts to 
                          take off.</p>
                        <p>So, quite naturally, I came into films.</p>
