                        Shyamaprasad, who bagged the Best Kerala State Award for 
                        his debut feature film Agnisakshi, is not a man of few 
                        words but, unlike many other directors, he is also a calm 
                        and unruffled man.<br> <br>
                        Yesterday, while speaking to The Peninsula at the Hotel 
                        Sofitel, with the scenic beauty of Qatar as a backdrop, 
                        he reminisced about the making of his film. Shyamaprasad 
                        said, &quot;Agnisakshi is more than a portrayal of the 
                        period and the life of the Nampoothiris of Kerala. It 
                        is more than the story of the transformation of a society 
                        caught between two worlds - one dead and the other yet 
                        to be born.<br> <br>
                        I don't know where to categorise this film because it 
                        is neiter an art film nor a commercial one.&quot; <br> 
                        <br>
                        Pausing for as moment he added, &quot;The film is more 
                        than the struggle between established values and change. 
                        It is more than the conflict between desire and duty. 
                        It is the story of every man who searches for meaning 
                        in relationship within the framework that society dictates 
                        in every age.&quot;<br> <br>
                        Holder of a master's degree in media studies from Hull 
                        University, England, Shyamaprasad has many award-winning 
                        and critically acclaimed works to his credit. His telefilm 
                        Nilavariyunnu won the special jury prize at the Golden 
                        Chest TV Fest held in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in 1996, and 
                        the Onida Pinnacle National Award for the Best Director 
                        in 1994. Shyam also won the Kerala State Award for the 
                        Best Director in 1993 and 1994. His much acclaimed telefilms 
                        include Maranam Durbalam and Uyirthezhunnelpu.<br> <br> 
                        &quot;I have been working on the Agnisakshi script for 
                        the past 10 to 12 years. The film is based on a Malayalam 
                        novel, the story of which was adapted for the film by 
                        Lalithambika Antharjanam. After working on the theme, 
                        the next stage was to select the stars. Though there are 
                        a lot of accomplished Malayalam film actors, none of them 
                        suited my vision of a hero. Thus I chose Rajath Kapoor 
                        for the main role as he had all the qualities of the character 
                        in question&quot;, he said. The other stars include Sobhana 
                        and Sreevidya.<br> <br>
                        &quot;My first thought was to make this a telefilm but 
                        later changed my mind as I later came to know that the 
                        novel was not suited to the teletube format. I started 
                        writing on the script somewhere n 1992 and my vision became 
                        a dream come true in August 1998, when I completed my 
                        movie.&quot; Due for release in Kerala by this month end, 
                        the film has already been acclaimed in the international 
                        arena.<br> <br>
                        &quot;I am targeting this film at the moviegoers who understand 
                        the realm of day-to-day life. People in the rest of India, 
                        as also in Kerala, want films based not on real life. 
                        But there are people who appreciate movies that I and 
                        other directors including Shyam Benegal like to do.&quot;<br> <br>
                        On what he feels on bagging 18 awards to date for his 
                        debut feature film, he said, &quot;I am elated by the 
                        response. Considering it is my first film and the laurels 
                        it has won, it's a great achievement.&quot; He is not 
                        resting on his laurels. The great director has already 
                        embarked on another film project, the details of which 
                        he did not divulge.<br> </td>
