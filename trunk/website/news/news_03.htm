                        &quot;Television is turning out to be a temporary shelter 
                        for unsuccessful film-makers who have no genuine interest 
                        in the small screen. They make films of absolutely no 
                        artistic value&quot;, says Shyamaprasad. In his case it 
                        wasn't quite true. In his Malayalam tele-film Nilavu Ariyunnu 
                        (The Moonlight Knows It All), which won the Onida pinnacle 
                        Award for best Telefilm (apart from four others), commercial 
                        success and artistic excellence have never been better 
                        balanced.<br>
                        <br>
                        Based on a short story written by Sara Joseph in the wake 
                        of the Bombay riots, the film pits an individual's psychological 
                        plight against the psyche of our socio-cultural structure. 
                        Fortunately, it is not yet another superficial interpretation 
                        of the sombre communal reality aided by technical virtuosity 
                        - sounds familiar?<br>
                        <br>
                        Unnikrishnan, the protagonist (played by debutant actor 
                        and producer MG Sasi, is returning to his village from 
                        Bombay with his helpless wife. Alagappan's haunting camera 
                        work helps us witness Unnikrishnan in the act of cleansing 
                        all his possessions of imaginary blood: currency notes, 
                        the paper he writes on, his shirt, all are subconsciously 
                        related to violence and evil. He washes even the idol 
                        of Ram as his bewildered family and the superstitious 
                        but concerned villagers watch. The ancestral beliefs and 
                        engulfing paranoia throw Unnikrishnan into a fatal tailspin. 
                        He dies groping for water under a moonlit sky on the parched 
                        bed of the river Nila that once flowed by his home.<br>
                        <br>
                        Shot on the banks of Bharatapuzha, in Deshamangalam and 
                        Thirumittakodu, Sara Joseph says the river is a central 
                        character in her short story. &quot;As I watched Shyamaprasad 
                        shoot, the nature of each shot, the beauty of each frame 
                        told me that he himself was deeply moved by the river. 
                        It was like finding a kindred spirit,&quot; says Joseph.<br>
                        <br>
                        But the director Shyamaprasad, finds the film depressing. 
                        &quot;I do not want to watch the film again, nor do my 
                        friends and family&quot; But it doesn't stop him from 
                        literary adaptations. Trained at the Pune Film Institute 
                        and Hull University in Lndon, Shyamaprasad, who has worked 
                        at Channel 4 and Yorkshire Television, is an ardent lover 
                        of Andrei Tarkovsky's films. His previous ventures have 
                        been based on works by writers ranging from Vaikkom Muhammad 
                        Basheer (Vishwavikhyatamay Mookku) to Kamal Das (Venalinte 
                        Ozhivu) to the French existentialist write Albert Camus 
                        (his film Uyirthezhunnelpu was based on Camus' play The 
                        Just).<br>
                        <br>
                        In fact the director of the Thiruvananthapuram Doordarshan 
                        Kendra banned Shyamaprasad (who is production assistant 
                        there) and his team from receiving teh State Government 
                        awards ostensibly because they were Central Government 
                        employees. Shyamaprasad received the award by defying 
                        the order and it is now awaiting disciplinary action.<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;Doordarshan initially rejected the script for Uyirthezhunnelpu 
                        on typical box office grounds. The authorities rejected 
                        the script as it tells the story of a group of tormented 
                        revolutionaries. They were not ready to accept a theme 
                        which was hitherto not attempted in mainstream media&quot;, 
                        says Shyamaprasad. Finally he submitted several scripts 
                        of the same film, each written from a different angle, 
                        and waited patiently for over six years to start production.<br>
                        <br>
                        When the tele-film was ready for telecast, the Doordarshan 
                        director suggested several changes in order to make it 
                        more 'patriotic'. Shyamaprasad did not budge. &quot;Still 
                        I believe that only Doordarshan could have produced a 
                        tele-film like Uyirthezhunnelpu&quot;, says he.<br>
                        <br>
                        He goes on to add, &quot;Those who control television 
                        are only too anxious to preserve the idiot box identity 
                        of the media. Yet TV is the only alternative, with the 
                        art of film-making crumbling under the weight of money-mad 
                        film-makers.&quot; Though Doordarshan has produced a number 
                        of films by serious film-makers, Shyamaprasad cites only 
                        Govind Nihalani's Tamas as having done justice to the 
                        medium. All the others, he says have utilised Doordarshan 
                        funds for making self-conscious movies.<br>
                        <br>
                        &quot;I feel that I am incompetent to make a film based 
                        on a story written by me. If I depend on a story which 
                        is already familiar to me, I can concentrate my whole 
                        energy on filming it,&quot; he says. He refuses to conform 
                        to the view that literature is a constraint on good cinema. 
                        &quot;It offers a better base for the film.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        For Joseph, Shyamaprasad's interpretation has been done 
                        with great care. &quot;In lesser hands my story would 
                        have lost its strength and beauty. Of course, MG Sasi's 
                        extraordinarily sensitive depiction of Unni (fr which 
                        he too won an Onida Award) and Alagappan's haunting camera 
                        work have also contributed to making the film an immensely 
                        rich experience. I was always confident that Shyam would 
                        never fail me for I had viewed his two earlier works, 
                        Venalinte Ozhivu and Uyirthezhunnelpu.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        Joseph says Unnikrishnan's tragedy is the fate of every 
                        honest youth doomed to suffer in the knowledge of the 
                        rot around us. Says she, &quot;My attempt in the short 
                        story was to explore the different planes of that torment. 
                        Unni's delirium and suffering are two different perspectives 
                        offered by my story. His delirium is a problem that concerns 
                        himself; he has to be exorcised of the devil or be treated 
                        by a psychiatrist. As for his suffering, the problem lies 
                        entirely with an afflicted world.&quot;<br>
